## example-arraysort 

### Overview 
This program provides an ascending odd sort over an array of numbers, keeping even numbers and 0
s in their places. Empty arrays are returned as-is. 

#### Example

`sortArray([5, 3, 2, 8, 1, 4])` returns the output `[1, 3, 2, 8, 5, 4]`

#### Usage 
Run the SorterApplication with the array you wish to sort as the command line arguments. 

In the above example, program arguments would be: 

`5 3 2 8 1 4`
